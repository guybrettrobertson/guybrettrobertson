### Hi, my name is Guy Brett-Robertson :wave:

I am a qualified insurance actuary with proven data science experience working at the Bank of England. This is my personal Github workspace. Here, you can find my code and projects on a range of subjects from algorithms to data visualisation and machine learning.

### What I've been working on :computer:

Check out the *autodidactic_sandbox* repo for my self-teaching materials and the *personal_projects* repo for information about the projects I've been working on. Most recently, I developed a model capable of determining whether a credit card transaction was fraudulent with an ROC AUC score of 99.7%.

### What drives me :seedling:

If there's one thing you should take away from this page, it is that I am obsessed with learning. After obtaining my integrated Master's degree in astrophysics, I spent four years training to become an actuary ([What is an actuary?](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/become-actuary/what-actuary)), and now I spend much of my spare time exploring interesting datasets, implementing and developing models (**Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow**), and reading up on innovative new techniques in the field of machine learning.

I believe that true insight comes from the cross-pollination of ideas from different domains, and that is why I have sought breadth as well as depth across a targetted range of scientific, mathematical, and computational fields. As an example, for my Master's thesis, I developed a Monte Carlo simulation (**Fortran**) for an exotic astrophysical phenomenon called the [cosmic ray air shower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_(physics)). This experience gave me a uniquely intuitive understanding of the Monte Carlo techniques that many insurance companies use to model the future.

### Professional experience :chart_with_upwards_trend:

After graduating from the University of St Andrews in 2015, I spent 1.5 years at an actuarial consultancy before moving to the Bank of England, where I have been working for the last 3.5 years. At the Bank, I have:

- Built a substantial **R** package as part of my department's actuarial software development team;
- Conducted deep-dive analysis of multiple FTSE 100 insurer's statistical risk and capital models;
- Developed expertise in specialist areas such as [proxy modelling](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/proxy-models-working-party-paper-240214.pdf), contributing to [industry publications](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2019/proxy-modelling-survey-best-observed-practice); and
- Championed data science good practices, providing training to c. 40 actuaries on data visualisation, version control, deep learning, and more.
