### Hi there, I'm Guy ðŸ‘‹

I am a qualified insurance actuary with proven data science experience working at the Bank of England. This is my personal Github workspace. Here, you can find my code and projects on a range of subjects from algorithms to data visualisation and machine learning.

### Professional experience

After graduating from the University of St Andrews in 2015, I spent 1.5 years at an actuarial consultancy before moving to the Bank of England, where I have been working for the last 3.5 years. At the Bank, I have:

- Built a substantial R package as part of my department's actuarial software development team;
- Conducted deep-dive analysis of multiple FTSE 100 insurer's statistical risk and capital models; and
- Championed data science good practices, providing training to c. 40 actuaries on data visualisation, version control and deep learning.
