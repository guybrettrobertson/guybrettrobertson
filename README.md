### Hi, my name is Guy Brett-Robertson :wave:

I am a qualified insurance actuary with proven data science experience working at the Bank of England. This is my personal Github workspace. Here, you can find my code and projects on a range of subjects from algorithms to data visualisation and machine learning.

### What I've been working on :computer:

Currently, I am developing my Python and SQL skills. Check out the *autodidactic_sandbox* repo for my self-teaching materials and the *personal_projects* repo for information about the projects I've been working on. Most recently, I developed a model capable of determining whether a news article was real or fake with an accuracy of 99%. I have also been developing machine learning algorithms from scratch to improve my understanding of these methods at a lower level of abstraction.

### What drives me :seedling:

If there's one thing you should take away from this page, it is that I am obsessed with learning. After obtaining my integrated Master's degree in astrophysics, I spent four years training to become an actuary ([What is an actuary?](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/become-actuary/what-actuary)), and now I spend much of my spare time exploring interesting datasets, implementing and developing models, and reading up on innovative new techniques in the field of machine learning.
