### Hi there, my name is Guy Brett-Robertson ðŸ‘‹

I am a qualified insurance actuary with proven data science experience working at the Bank of England. This is my personal Github workspace. Here, you can find my code and projects on a range of subjects from algorithms to data visualisation and machine learning.

If there's one thing you should take away from this page, it is that I am obsessed with learning. After obtaining my Bachelor's and Master's degree in astrophysics, I spent four years studying to become an actuary ([What is an actuary?](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/become-actuary/what-actuary)), and now I spend much of my spare time working with interesting new datasets, implementing and developing models (**Python**, **Scikit-Learn**, **Tensorflow**), and learning about innovative new techniques in the field of machine learning.

I believe that true insight comes from the cross-pollination of ideas from different domains, and that is why I have sought breadth as well as depth across a targetted variety of of scientific, mathematical, and computational fields. 

### What I'm working on



### Professional experience

After graduating from the University of St Andrews in 2015, I spent 1.5 years at an actuarial consultancy before moving to the Bank of England, where I have been working for the last 3.5 years. At the Bank, I have:

- Built a substantial **R** package as part of my department's actuarial software development team;
- Conducted deep-dive analysis of multiple FTSE 100 insurer's statistical risk and capital models;
- Developed expertise in specialist areas such as proxy modelling, contributing to [industry publications](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2019/proxy-modelling-survey-best-observed-practice); and
- Championed data science good practices, providing training to c. 40 actuaries on data visualisation, version control, deep learning, and more.
