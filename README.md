### Hi, my name is Guy Brett-Robertson :wave:

I am a senior actuary in data analytics at RGA (previously PwC and the Bank of England). This is my personal Github workspace. Here, you can find my code and projects on a range of subjects from algorithms to data visualisation and machine learning.

### What I've been working on :computer:

Check out the [autodidactic_sandbox](https://github.com/guybrettrobertson/autodidactic_sandbox) repo for my self-teaching materials and the [personal_projects](https://github.com/guybrettrobertson/personal_projects) repo for information about the projects I worked on. Most recently, I developed a model to create a chat bot based on any WhatsApp message history. I have also developed machine learning algorithms from scratch to understand these methods at a lower level of abstraction.

See these pages for notebooks of problems that I've solved:
* [AlgoExpert](https://github.com/guybrettrobertson/autodidactic_sandbox/tree/master/problem_solving/algo_expert)
* [Leetcode](https://github.com/guybrettrobertson/autodidactic_sandbox/tree/master/problem_solving/leetcode_problems)
* [Project Euler](https://github.com/guybrettrobertson/autodidactic_sandbox/tree/master/problem_solving/euler_problems)
